       "['Big Data refers to the humongous amount of data which is tracked by businesses on a day to day basis. This data is majorly unstructured; and is generated by routing business processes running on a daily basis. The nature of Big Data in organizations is defined by <b>3Vs – Volume, Velocity & Variety</b>. ‘Volume’ refers to the large quantum of data in terabytes which may be transactional data, customer data etc. ‘Velocity’ refers to the rate at which the data is generated which could be either scheduled batch process, or real-time data collection. Finally, ‘variety’ denotes the variation in the data formats and structures.<br> <br> Data science, on the other hand, is a more specialized field which involves using mathematical & statistical modelling techniques on underlying data to devise patterns in data; and find actionable solutions to real-world problems.',\n",
       " 'There’s not much of a difference between data scientist & business analysts in terms of the acquired skillsets & acumen; however, the application of the acquired skills differs. Data scientists deep dive into the technical side of things focusing on the mathematical & statistical relationship between data, optimal data mining techniques and devising on the best fit model to describe the underlying data.<br> <br>Business Analyst, on the other hand, focuses on the front-end side of things wherein they are responsible in identifying workable business problems and translate them into statistical business intelligence problems. They are also involved in converting statistical outputs to actionable insights which can be consumed by the business in devising related strategies around it.',\n",
       " 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the concept wherein machines and systems are enabled to work like human beings using multiple self-learning algorithms such as decision trees, what-if analysis etc. <br>Machine learning is the most famous method of implementing Artificial intelligence concept which works on the principle of teaching machines to learn from data & experience. The business logic for machine learning systems are typically not coded; rather they self-initiate processes based on previous experience. <br>Data Science is a more specific field of study which deals in usage of scientific & statistical methods to derive valuable insights. Machine learning is an important subset of data science which deals in supervised machines by equipping them to self-learn from data patterns and trends.\\n',\n",
       " 'Data science is the super-set which encompasses Big Data technologies as well; however, students specializing in Big Data & Data science have certain demarcations both in terms of the specialized skillsets they acquire & hone, as well as the opportunities & demand in the market. Both Big Data analysts as well as data scientist need to be focussed on ‘data’ – however, big data analyst should emphasize on data organizational & structuring and creating a mechanism wherein business analysts & data scientist can seamlessly access the requisite data.  <br><br>Data scientist, on the other hand, focuses on application of machine learning techniques & algorithms on the accessed data to derive actionable insights. Therefore, the choice of specialization depends largely on the interest level of the candidates – a more technically blended student should progress in the field of Big Data while a more statistically inclined student should look for data science as a career prospect.',\n",
       " 'Data Analytics, Business Analytics and Data Science, though different connotations, has a rather thin line of demarcation between them. Data Analytics is primarily based on massaging & harmonizing the back-end unstructured data of the business; and make them usable and presentable to the business analysts (who in turn would derive insights from them). Key data related tools & technologies such as RDBMS, Hadoop/Hive, SQL etc. are a must for a successful career in data analytics. <br> <br> Data science relates to the application of mathematical & statistical algorithms to the cleaned data provided by data analysts. These candidates are generally postgraduates in economics, statistics with a flair in data modelling. <br> <br>Business Analytics requires maximum exposure to business (amongst these three roles) and is primarily responsible in providing a business touch to the technical/mathematical problems being solved by the data analyst or data scientists. An ideal candidate for business analytics should be an MBA-graduate with a stint in business.']"

      "e courses on r programming in addition board infinity would also guide the individual in making an attractive portfolio which could help him her get interesting freelance projects microsoft excel though being the most fundamental and basic tool for data analysis is used extensively primarily due to its flexibility ease of usage students can learn excel from variety of online sources such as the microsoft online community excel central excel hero mr excel and so on more importantly users can simply browse the help centre in the excel window to learn more about each of the formulae and functionalities used in excel a data scientist should have an optimal mix of data crunching mathematical acumen statistical know how and the requisite technical visualization skills to implement present the findings to end users assuming that you do not have any prior knowledge on programming or statistics it is important that you kickstart your journey with relatively simple programming languages such as python or r as these languages are widely used in data science and are must to know br this would help you to run basic programs and get comfortable with the programming once you are comfortable with one of the programming language you can start reading the basics of statistics and then practice the same on the programming language which you learned as these languages provide quite many libraries and tools to make you do the statistical analysis with few lines of code the best way to learn data science is to start with understanding data as it forms more than of the overall work involved in data science projects students need to understand data engineering i e how to treat and manipulate raw and unstructured data in a way so as to make it eligible to run statistical analysis on top of it br once this is done the next step is to learn any scripting language in depth preferably python which can be used to apply statistical models on the cleaned data the understanding of a scripting language would enable the student to implement the concepts learned with real world data and see the outputs finally once the student is comfortable with the basics of statistics and python he can then proceed towards more complicated statistical models predictive analytics the career path of data scientists invariably varies from organizations to organizations while in some businesses there are clear demarcations between data engineers statistical modelers and visualizers in others theres some overlap between the roles as well hence a data scientist invariably starts from the data engineering part wherein they clean and manage raw data to design a data lake on which further analysts can be done post this they gradually progress towards more sophisticated roles of statistical modelers and business analysts the best websites to learn data science includes kaggle analyticsvidhya towardsdatascience machinelearningmastery etc students can visit these sites to understand the various concepts on data science as well as practice data science problems with real data also students may visit a href target _blank data science column a of board infinity as well to get in depth idea on different learning paths connected to data science and how to build a rewarding career in this field there are multiple online sources and tutorials to learn data science the most frequently used sources are towardsdatascience analyticsvidhya machinelearningmastery board infinity data science column etc other than that there are numerous articles and

topics there are various websites of top researchers in the particular field although most of the students and learners prefer the online route there are multiple quality books as well in data science divided across its different streams such as statistics machine learning nlp deep learning etc the book on introduction to statistical learning by gareth james daniela witten trevor hastie and robert tibshirani is a worthy start to the world of statistics other than that there is a book named the hundred page machine learning book by andriy burkov which gives an excellent perspective on machine learning the book on deep learning with python by francois chollet presents a good introduction of python as a useful tool for data science as well the range of subjects which falls under the umbrella of data science ranges from learning the basics of statistics probability to learning programming language such as sas r to finally learning effective communication skills to present the findings to business stakeholders therefore the subjects are quite diverse still the core subjects are at least one programming language preferably python machine learning statistics probability software engineering finally effective communication although there are predefined functions commands in programming languages such as python r sas etc which performs the statistical modelling in the background students must have a basic know how of the algorithm or hypothesis used by these statistical methods a good starting point could be to understand the metrics of variation central tendency followed by different hypothesis testing and finally progressing towards more complicated classification logistic algorithms talking of data analysis as a subject there are three branches to it b descriptive analysis predictive analysis and prescriptive analysis b the role of statistics is minimal in descriptive analysis which focuses on identifying trends in business performance and attributing trends and patterns to various factors or variables but in both predictive prescriptive analysis students must be aware of few of the frequently used modelling techniques such as classification algorithms clustering logistic models and other multi variate models as well the topics covered in data science depending upon the level of the course i e whether students are enrolling for a basic course or a more advanced course basic courses generally introduce the student to concepts of statistics and probability and then proceed towards preliminary hypothesis testing procedure such as t test z test anova f test etc and finally advances to cause effect modelling such as regression factor analysis logistic analysis etc br advanced courses on the other hand starts with regression analysis and then progresses to more complicated algorithms such as random forest decision trees bayesian principles collaborative filtering and so on the preference usage of programming languages depend largely on the use cases to which it is applied while the financial services prefer sas over other technologies other businesses prefer python r over sas as per a survey conducted by kaggle python sql r are the leading programming languages preferred by data analyst research also says that out of data scientists prefer to learn python therefore with a certain level of subjectivity python can be considered as the best programming language for data analysis given the massive appeal and acceptance of machine learning in businesses across the globe there are multiple languages which are compatible to the ml framework a few of the programming languages which are used to implement machine learning projects are python javascript c c r scala typescript julia java shell etc however there have been multiple researches done on the most preferred programming language wherein there is tough competition between python r with python getting the nod data science as a whole or even machine learning requires intricate knowledge of mathematics especially algebra as most of the machine learning algorithms are based out of linear algebra a few of the topics which are a must for all students aiming to pursue a career in data science are matrix theory graph theory optimization algorithms multivariate calculus and a detailed study of linear algebra the word excel in data analysis points to the usage of microsoft excel in analysing sets of data to bring out useful insights from the same while the usage of microsoft excel is common in analytics and brings in a lot of flexibility in analysis it is not a scalable tool as excel cannot be used to manipulate or work with large volume of unstructured data however for small scale analysis on tabular data only excel can be used as a decent tool for data analysis students and aspirants in the field of data science must be cognizant of the fact that the acceptance of their statistical models and output depend largely on their relevance to existing business problems therefore it is important for data scientist to understand the actual problems faced by business their priorities and the projects and analysis done should correspond or cater to those business problems for example a student from finance background would have sound knowledge on accounting concepts which would help him her to understand the financial problems faced by businesses hence they could cater their reporting solutions to correspond to such problems data science professionals aspirants being majorly from statistics background tend to face certain issues and problems using python as it is a programming language based on oops concept they are mostly comfortable using r as it majorly caters to statistical projects however for projects related to machine learning knowledge of python is required also python has a lot of inbuilt functions and commands which are important for data science projects hence becoming a data scientist without learning python is not impossible but definitely not advisable whether data scientist need to learn web development or not largely depend on the organization that he or she is working for larger companies there are dedicated teams for web development who caters to the deployment of applications to the web and data scientists are more focussed on delivering relevant models catering to specific business problems br however for smaller organizations and start ups data scientists may need to learn the basics of web development as they may be required to deploy their applications on the web becoming a successful data scientist without knowledge and acumen in mathematics or statistics is highly improbable as these are the fundamental blocks of data science all statistical models optimization algorithms machine learning algorithms classification techniques etc are based out of mathematical and statistical concepts specifically linear algebra although tools such as python r has pre defined commands to cater to these functionalities still a data scientist needs to understand the basics of these concepts now a day with the sophistication of the programming languages and tools available there are pre defined methods and libraries for virtually everything and data scientist need not code the logic by themselves however a successful data scientist must be aware of the algorithms in terms of what they are doing and in which use cases can they be used br a software engineer on the other hand need not be adept in data structure or data science algorithms rather there task is to create and design an application which could consume in the data science model and provide relevant output to businesses data analysis or a data analyst and data science or a data scientist are two different facets of analytics with different objectives roles responsibilities hence it is important for the student to first understand the key requirement of each of the two profiles and make an informed choice on whether they wish to progress towards data analysis or data science br data analysis is a more analytics centric role wherein the both software as well as analytical acumen of the student would be tested the ability to process terabytes of data design extensive data lakes good know how on database management system sql and churning insightful reports for businesses etc are mandatory skills of a data analyst br the requirement of data scientist is different and relates more on knowledge of statistics mathematical models as well as scripting languages such as python etc hence based on the existing skillsets interest of the student an informed decision needs to be made br there is certain level of correlation between the two as well as data analysis is an integral part of descriptive analytics while data science forms a part of predictive and prescriptive analytics as a data scientist what tips would you have for a younger version of yourself in order to become a successful data scientist it is important not to jump the gun and directly delve into statistical models and python r commands which could simply take inputs and provide the model output rather the process should be more organic and synchronous wherein i would start with preparing the basics of mathematics statistics and then progress towards finer details br in addition to this the approach to solving problems is another important aspect simply solving problems would not help until it has a business flavour to it whether data scientist need to learn web development or not largely depend on the organization that he or she is working for larger companies there are dedicated teams for web development who caters to the deployment of applications to the web and data scientists are more focussed on delivering relevant models catering to specific business problems br however for smaller organizations and start ups data scientists may need to learn the basics of web development as they may be required to deploy their applications on the web the typical time taken to learn python largely depends on educational background of the student in terms of whether the student has any prior experience in programming language the syntax and semantics of python is pretty similar to any other object oriented programming language hence any candidate with prior experience can learn python in a month is time br however for freshers in the field of computer programming he she needs to get comfortable with the syntax which could take anywhere between to months the key challenge to finding practical data analysis problems in the online domain is that the data provided in online practical sites such as kaggle etc are much cleaner and more manageable whereas the data in real world business scenario is much more complicated unclean and unstructured therefore there is no precise or absolute website or any other online source wherein students can get first hand experience on solving practical data analysis problems br still the best website to practice data analysis problem in kaggle wherein students are recommended to formulate their own research questions and then collect relevant data from scrapping different websites portals and government stats site this would help them gain real time experience in solving practical data problems the collection of raw data to perform data analysis in excel depends largely on the particular use case that the student wish to address for example in case of any descriptive analysis on economical data such as gdp growth rates repo rates bank rates etc the relevant governmental statistical websites are the most authentic other than that there are other online sources as well to find data for analysis such as kdnuggets machine learning repository by uci the k datasets from movielens data mining implementation repository kaggle datasets etc br all of these data can be readily imported to excel for high end analysis visualization there are multiple platforms which students can use to implement data science projects a few of them are open source platforms as well basis a survey conducted by analytics insight the top platforms used by data scientist aspirants and professionals are matlab mainly used for machine learning projects tibco statistica referred for ai problems and other data science modelling problems alteryx analytics most famously used for predictive analytics and other business intelligence problems rapidminer studio also used for designing and optimizing machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and text mining databricks analytics platform also used for ai applications etc although microsoft excel is the most fundamental tool for practicing data analysis and data science projects for beginners it has a scalability problem wherein it cannot accommodate data sizes exceeding a certain limit for this beginners and data science aspirants are recommended to use python as a platform for practising data science skills they can download the required data sets from kaggle or other open data sources such as government statistics sites etc import them to python and perform high end analysis on them data science case studies offer a perfect platform for students to understand the ground level realities of data science in terms of how they are implemented in business organizations the netflix use case on how they implemented leveraged data science to improvise and renovate their recommendation engine is one of the best full data science case study which can be accessed from the blog section of the data flair training platform br other case studies which can be referred are facebook using data science for social media networking amazon using data science for transforming e commerce uber using data science to make rides better etc all of these can be obtained from data flair training blogs while there may be multiple communities tutorials and moocs available for data science getting a genuine mentor is a challenging task this is where the mentorship program at board infinity comes into the picture wherein students can be mentored on various learning paths based on their innate skills and interests br other than that students can also look for data science experts via professional networking sites such as linkedin and seek guidance from him her furthermore there are multiple data science specific groups on slack as well which students can take advantage of data analyst and data scientist has a lot of roles and responsibilities in common depending upon the industry or company that the individual is engaged in however in general students need to develop their skillsets and acumen in the field of statistics to make a transition from data analyst to data scientist students can scale up in statistics starting from basic probability algebraic concepts and then progressing towards more complicated stuffs br another important concept which data analyst needs to upskill to become a data scientist is coding specifically in python as this is a mandate for developing data science models and algorithms data science has relevance in almost all fields of businesses starting from the banking sector to healthcare to retail and even agricultural sector as well a few of the best applications of data science as per survey performed by edureka are risk analysis fraud detection which is one of the most important use cases in the bfsi sector search engine optimization designing custom and targeted campaigns for marketing devising recommendation engines which is extensively practiced in netflix etc br data science are also applied in speech recognition traffic management designing optimal routing plan for air traffic and many more big data analysis has requirement in every facets of businesses however the usage of data analysis depends on the leverage that the businesses are able to perform on the underlying data infrastructures which they possess a few of the fields wherein big data analysis is done to a great impact are banking sector wherein transactional data in huge volume is available to analyse potential risks and opportunities communication media businesses wherein they use big data to devise marketing strategies which would be most effective for customers retail sectors specifically in areas of e commerce and many more\n"
